                        <h2>Why HZ University</h2>
                        <p>
                            I chose HZ University because it focuses on learning by doing. The ICT program is practical
                            and project-based,
                            which helps me understand and apply what I learn instead of only studying theory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ICT is a fast-growing field with many career options. At HZ, I'm building real skills in
                            programming,
                            problem-solving, and software development that prepare me for the job market.

                <h2>Why ICT at HZ University</h2>

                       <p>
    I chose ICT at HZ University of Applied Sciences because the program is project-based and practical. 
    This approach gives me hands-on experience and prepares me for real workplace challenges, not just exams. 
    Learning by doing was the main reason I decided to study here.
</p>
<p>
    The ICT program builds a solid foundation in core concepts while allowing me to specialize in areas I'm most interested in. 
    By working on real projects throughout my studies, I gain experience that employers value and that I can use directly in my career.
</p>
<p>
    I've always loved programming and creating new things, whether it's building software, solving problems, 
    or experimenting with new technologies. HZ gives me the opportunity to turn that passion into real skills 
    and prepare for a meaningful career in ICT.
</p>
<p>
    My goal is to graduate with both strong knowledge and practical experience. 
    Thanks to HZ's HBO approach, I'll be ready to contribute from day one in the tech industry.
